Building artist-focused tooling with Flow integration for compositors and editors.

Working on a modern pipeline based around Flow and rez.

2020
:	**Application Vulnerability Testing**, [Robot Talk](https://www.robottalk.tv) (New York)

Led local application tests for a multi-platform Electron / Go based application. Used discreet proxy and fuzzing tools to inspect traffic and API endpoints. Compiled vulnerability report as part of overall client security remediation audit.

2019-2021
:	**Freelance VFX Technical Director Consultant** (Global)

Leveraging 11 years of Visual Effects (VFX) industry experience, consultant for various studios to assist them with their technical needs including pipeline, infrastructure and artist tools.

Recent tasks have included Flame and Windows pipeline integration.

2014-2019
:	**Senior Pipeline Technical Director**, [Framestore](https://www.framestore.com/) (New York, London)

After working as a VFX artist, made the transition to Pipeline/2D Technical Director (TD).  A Technical Director is a **development and operations** role involving writing code and managing the infrastructure that supports production.

Hired by Framestore for my combination of programming skill and experience as a compositor to be the point person for the 2D aspects of their new Integrated Advertising pipeline.

Key Pipeline TD accomplishments:

* Co-winner of [2015 Shotgun 'Shotty' Award](https://www.shotgridsoftware.com/blog/2015-pipeline-awards-recipients/) for our team's work with SGTK.
* Personally co-designed and implemented many of our **core 2d workflows** -- Ingest Publishing, 'The Lockdown', Interactive Publish Visualization Badges, Prerender Bypass, Editorial Ingest and Conform, Review and Export to Client.
* Helped integrate **Shotgun / SGTK** into the studio and educate artists / leads about these tools.
* Wrote **GUI (PyQt / PySide) and command line tools** to interact with the pipeline.
* Wrote **extra actions for the Loader** and Workfiles Manager to simplify common artist tasks. Also helped bridge these actions directly into Nuke via shim.
* Helped integrate automated **OCIO/ACES** color management into our environment.
* Developed artist/management tools to leverage the **'metadata web'** that is built during production.

Key 2D TD accomplishments:

* Working closely with artists, **integrated / modified many SGTK apps** to better fit our usage patterns, passing code / comments back to Shotgun.
* Developed **user-friendly** renderfarm, asset library and client download area integration for Nuke and Hiero.
* Massively improved the **tk-hiero-export** app to support timeline exports, published audio and modular updates of SG Shot fields.
* Wrote a few **show-specific Nuke tools** e.g. a screenspace rigging tool.
* **Debugged and Optimized** complex Nuke / Hiero scripts from production, often with gdb.

Other accomplishments:

* **Managed code releases** for multiple libraries across dozens of projects and multiple versions of Nuke / Hiero simultaneously **across four time zones**.
* Managed and **defended the codebase**, insisting on global collaboration and relevance before making changes; Saying 'no'.
* **Clearly communicated** complex workflows and tools to artists.
* **Tutored** junior / new members of the team.

2008-2014
:	**Freelance and Staff Compositor** (New York, London)

Worked for 6 years as a Compositor (VFX artist) across multiple films, TV shows and advertisement campaigns, including the Oscar nominated film "Inside Llewyn Davis" and the James Bond Film "Spectre".

Performed start-to-finish compositing (paint and roto, 2d and 3d tracking, keying, color correction and full comp work) for at least 30 TV and Film projects in Shake and Nuke.  Proficient at both 'invisible effects' and complex multi-pass CG compositing.
